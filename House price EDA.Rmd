## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
train = read.csv('train.csv')
summary(train)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(train, aes(x= GarageYrBlt, y= YearBuilt)) + geom_point(aes(color = SalePrice)) +
  scale_color_gradient2(low = 'white', mid = 'red', high = 'darkgreen', midpoint = 200000)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
